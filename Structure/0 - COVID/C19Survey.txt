<p>Ofgem commissioned a telephone <strong>survey</strong> of <strong>consumers</strong> in April 2020 to assess the <strong>impact</strong> (if any) the outbreak of <strong>Covid-19</strong> has had on their electricity and gas arrangements.&nbsp; 526 adults in Scotland aged 18+ who are solely or jointly responsible for paying the energy bills in their household were surveyed.&nbsp; Care should be taken with these results due to the small sample size and likelihood that timing may affect responses.</p>
<p>Headline findings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most respondents have <strong>not had an issue</strong> with energy bills or supply (<strong>88%</strong>). <strong>6%</strong> of respondents have been trying <strong>unsuccessfully</strong> to <strong>contact</strong> their energy <strong>supplier</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>58%</strong> of respondents report <strong>using more energy</strong> than usual and <strong>35%</strong> have thought about the <strong>impact</strong> on energy <strong>bills</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>22%</strong> are <strong>concerned</strong> about their energy <strong>supply</strong> being <strong>affected</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>38%</strong> of <strong>prepayment</strong> Meter (PPM) consumers are worried about <strong>affordability</strong> and <strong>37%</strong> are worried about being able to <strong>top up</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>15%</strong> of non-PPM consumers are worried about <strong>falling behind</strong> on energy <strong>bills</strong>.</li>
<li>Most respondents have <strong>not contacted</strong> anyone for <strong>information</strong> or <strong>advice</strong> about energy (<strong>92%</strong>). <strong>5%</strong> have <strong>contacted</strong> <strong>friends and family</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>One in three</strong> have <strong>received information</strong> from their <strong>supplier</strong> about what they are doing to manage operations and customer service. This information was found to be easy to understand and informative by a majority of these respondents.</li>
</ul>
