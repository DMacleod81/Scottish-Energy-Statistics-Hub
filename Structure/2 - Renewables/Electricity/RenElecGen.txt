Looking at the latest quarter, 7,358 GWh of renewable electricity was generated in 2022 Q2, higher than any quarter 2 reported previously. This most likely came from an increase in the amount of wind and East Moray coming online at the end of the first quarter. 

In 2021, 27.5 TWh of renewable electricity was generated in Scotland. This is a 14.3% decrease compared to 2020, which is likely due to the milder weather throughout the year.

Scotland made up almost a quarter (22.5%) of the UK’s renewable electricity generation in 2021.

The majority of Scotland’s renewable electricity generation continues to come from wind (19.9 TWh in 2021). 2.7 TWh was generated via offshore wind, down from 3.5 TWh in 2020. 17.2 TWh was generated by onshore wind.
