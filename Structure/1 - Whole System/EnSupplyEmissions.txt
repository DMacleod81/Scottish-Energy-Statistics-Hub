<p>From a <strong>baseline</strong> of <strong>22.7 million tonnes of CO2</strong>, greenhouse gas<strong> emissions</strong> from the <strong>energy supply</strong> sector have <strong>fallen 70.1%</strong> to <strong>6.8 million tonnes of CO2</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>. This in large part due to changes in <strong>electricity production</strong>, where a <strong>reduction</strong> in the use of <strong>fossil fuels</strong> for electricity generation has led to an <strong>85.4%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in emissions to <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions associated with <strong>industry</strong> have also <strong>fallen</strong>, from a <strong>baseline</strong> of <strong>8.0 million tonnes of CO2</strong> to <strong>4.7 million tonnes of CO2</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>, a <strong>decrease</strong> of <strong>41.7%.</strong></p>
