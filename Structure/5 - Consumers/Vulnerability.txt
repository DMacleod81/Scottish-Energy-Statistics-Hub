<p style="font-weight: 400;">Energy companies have a duty to support the specific needs of people in vulnerable circumstances.&nbsp; Data from Ofgem shows that progress made is mixed:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Customers in Scotland&nbsp;<strong>repaying</strong>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>debt</strong>&nbsp;to their electricity and gas supplier decreased since 2006, and has levelled off in recent years to&nbsp;<strong>2.4%</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2.5%</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">However, this does not mean that customers in arrears has declined.&nbsp; The proportion of customers in&nbsp;<strong>arrears</strong>&nbsp;<strong>without</strong>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>repayment plan</strong>&nbsp;set up has&nbsp;<strong>risen</strong>&nbsp;slightly, from&nbsp;<strong>1.5%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2012</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>2.6%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>, and from&nbsp;<strong>1.7%</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>2.5%</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>.&nbsp; This might suggest that their supplier might not engage customers falling behind on their bills effectively or there might be a delay in contact.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A debt repayment arrangement is a specific formal arrangement between a supplier and a customer to repay outstanding arrears, and suppliers should be proactive in setting them up.&nbsp; The proportion of customers in&nbsp;<strong>debt</strong>&nbsp;and who have a&nbsp;<strong>repayment</strong>&nbsp;<strong>arrangement</strong>&nbsp;set up&nbsp;<strong>dropped</strong>&nbsp;from approximately&nbsp;<strong>three quarters</strong>&nbsp;of electricity and gas customers in&nbsp;<strong>2012</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>half</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">More customers in Scotland are on a&nbsp;<strong>Priority Services Register</strong>&nbsp;(PSR).&nbsp; This is a free service that provides a range of services to help potentially vulnerable customers manage their energy account if they need extra support.&nbsp; It has increased from&nbsp;<strong>2.8%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2006</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>21.5%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;of all&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>&nbsp;customers, and from&nbsp;<strong>3.8%</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>21.6%</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>gas.</strong></li>
</ul>
