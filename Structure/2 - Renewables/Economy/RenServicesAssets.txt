<p>ONS publishes analysis to quantify the economic value of Scotland&rsquo;s natural capital <strong>assets</strong>, and the value of the <strong>flow of services</strong> from these assets.&nbsp; For example, in the <strong>renewables</strong> context, the value of services relate to the profit from generating and selling electricity. The assets would be the capacity of the environment to provide power, through rain, wind, and sun, at sites of renewable generation.</p>
<p>The annual value of renewable energy provisioning <strong>services</strong> increased as renewable generation grew, up from <strong>&pound;5 million</strong> in <strong>2010</strong> to <strong>&pound;199 million</strong> in <strong>2016</strong>.&nbsp; The <strong>Scottish</strong> <strong>renewables service</strong> is worth <strong>29%</strong> of the <strong>UK</strong> value in <strong>2016</strong>.</p>
<p>The estimated value of renewable energy <strong>assets</strong> in Scotland is <strong>&pound;3.4 billion</strong>, more than a five-fold increase from <strong>&pound;0.67 billion</strong> in <strong>2011</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
