<p>Scottish Government commissioned a follow up survey to Ofgem&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/what-are-consumers-experiences-energy-during-covid-19-emergency">GB survey of energy consumers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondents were asked about the <strong>impact</strong> (if any) the outbreak of <strong>Covid-19</strong> has had on their <strong>electricity</strong> and <strong>gas</strong> arrangements.&nbsp; Results are compared against the Scottish sample from the first wave which was conducted in April while the country was under lockdown.&nbsp; The second wave of the survey was conducted just after Scotland entered phase 2 of its route map out of lockdown.</p>
<p>851 adults in Scotland aged 18+ who are solely or jointly responsible for paying the energy bills in their household were surveyed by telephone between 22-29<sup>th</sup> July 2020. This was administered via Ipsos MORI&rsquo;s CATI Omnibus survey.&nbsp; Data have been weighted using the demographic data collected.&nbsp; Care should be taken with these results due to the small sample size.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Headline findings:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Most respondents have <strong>not had an issue</strong> with <strong>energy</strong> bills or supply (<strong>85%</strong>). <strong>Younger consumers</strong> and those <strong>living in the most deprived areas</strong> were <strong>most likely to experience issues</strong>.</li>
<li>Levels of concern about energy matters as a result of lockdown and social distancing remained low &ndash; <strong>14%</strong> were <strong>worried</strong> about <strong>building up debt</strong>, <strong>12%</strong> were <strong>worried</strong> about their <strong>energy supply</strong> being affected and <strong>11%</strong> were concerned about <strong>falling behind</strong> on <strong>energy bills </strong>due to <strong>reduced income</strong>. Each of these concerns was <strong>greater</strong> among the <strong>16-34 year old</strong> age group.</li>
<li>Just <strong>21%</strong> of <strong>prepayment</strong> meter consumers are worried about being able to <strong>top up</strong> and <strong>20%</strong> were worried about <strong>affordability</strong>, both <strong>down</strong> from the <strong>April</strong> results.</li>
<li>Most respondents have not contacted anyone for information or advice about energy (92%).</li>
<li><strong>42%</strong> received <strong>information</strong> from their <strong>supplier</strong> about what they are doing to manage operations and customer service, <strong>up</strong> from <strong>33%</strong> in <strong>April</strong>. This information was found to be easy to understand, informative, helpful, useful and reassuring by a majority of these respondents.</li>
