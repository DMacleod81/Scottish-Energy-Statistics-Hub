<p><strong>2019</strong> was a <strong>record year</strong> for <strong>renewable electricity generation</strong> in Scotland with <strong>30.5 TWh</strong> generated, <strong>13.6% up</strong> on <strong>2018</strong>. This is the equivalent of powering all households in Scotland for over three years, or charging almost 6.7 billion mobile phones for a year.</p>
<p><strong>Scotland</strong> made up over a quarter (<strong>25.3%</strong>) of the <strong>UK</strong>&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation in 2019.</p>
<p>Scotland hit a new record high for quarterly renewable electricity generation in&nbsp;<strong>Q1 2020</strong>, with <strong>11.6 TWh</strong> generated between January and March 2020.&nbsp;This is <strong>up 28%</strong> on the same period last year, and is equivalent to about half of Scotland's total electricity consumption. <strong>Increases</strong> in <strong>rainfall</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>wind speed</strong> contributed to this - compared to Q1 2019, <strong>onshore&nbsp;wind</strong> generation is <strong>up 25%</strong>, <strong>hydro</strong> generation is <strong>up 38%</strong> and <strong>offshore wind</strong> generation <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>54%</strong></p>
<p>The majority of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation continues to come from <strong>wind</strong> (<strong>22.3 TWh </strong>in <strong>2019</strong>). <strong>Offshore wind</strong> grew substantially in <strong>2019</strong>; <strong>3.2 TWh</strong> was generated last year via offshore wind, up from <strong>1.4 TWh</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>. This is due to the Beatrice wind farm off the Caithness coast becoming fully operational in May 2019.</p>
