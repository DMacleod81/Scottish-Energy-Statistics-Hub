<p>The electricity generation mix in Scotland has significantly changed in recent years driven by privatisation and subsidy schemes introduced to encourage the development of low carbon and renewable technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has meant that the vast majority of the electricity that Scotland generates is from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;sources,&nbsp;<strong>83.2%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, <strong>compared to 15.6% generated from fossil fuels.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, electricity generation from fossil fuels increased in the most recent year, up from&nbsp;<strong>10.2%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>. Generation from natural&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;reached its&nbsp;<strong>highest point</strong>&nbsp;since&nbsp;<strong>2011</strong>. Gas electricity generation may be making up for a&nbsp;<strong>drop</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>nuclear</strong>&nbsp;electricity generation (<strong>36.5%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>28.0%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>) stemming from long-term outages at Hunterston B towards the end of 2018.&nbsp; As such,&nbsp;<strong>nuclear</strong>&nbsp;generation is at its&nbsp;<strong>lowest</strong>&nbsp;level since&nbsp;<strong>2007</strong>.</p>
<p>The sources of electricity generation in Scotland have changed rapidly since&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>&nbsp;when approximately half of Scotland&rsquo;s generation came from&nbsp;each of&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;sources and&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuels</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>growth of renewables drove the increase in low carbon generation</strong>, rising from&nbsp;<strong>19.0%</strong>&nbsp;of all generation in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>55.2%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;National and international incentives, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro">Renewables Obligation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive">EU Renewable Energy Directive</a>, contributed towards the increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<strong>England and Wales</strong>&nbsp;use a significantly&nbsp;<strong>smaller proportion</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong> <strong>(47.6%)</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>renewable (28.9%)</strong>&nbsp;sources for electricity generation than Scotland.&nbsp;<strong>Fossil fuels</strong>&nbsp;comprise half (<strong>49.6%</strong>) of England and Wales&rsquo; electricity generation, with&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;making up most of this (<strong>43.7% of all generation</strong>).</p>
