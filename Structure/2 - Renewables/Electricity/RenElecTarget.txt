<p>The Scottish Government has a target to generate the equivalent of&nbsp;<strong>100%</strong>&nbsp;of Scotland&rsquo;s own electricity demand from renewable sources by&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean that Scotland will be fully dependent on renewables generation, but rather that renewables will form the key part of a wider, balanced electricity mix.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, the equivalent of <strong>89.5% </strong>of gross electricity consumption* was from renewable sources, rising from&nbsp;<strong>76.2% </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp; This increase stems from the <strong>3.7 TWh</strong> increase in <strong>renewable electricity generation</strong>, of which, <strong>1.8 TWh</strong> was from <strong>offshore wind</strong> and <strong>1.1 TWh</strong> from <strong>onshore wind</strong>.</p>
<p>Scotland's ability to meet the 100% target by 2020 will depend on how much renewable electricity generation increases and gross consumption decreases in the next year.&nbsp; As of <strong>September 2020</strong>, Scotland has&nbsp;<strong>11.8 GW</strong>&nbsp;of installed <strong>capacity</strong> operational with&nbsp;<strong>13.9 GW&nbsp;</strong>in the&nbsp;<strong>pipeline</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;How quickly these projects become operational, how favourable the climate is for renewable electricity generation and the extent to which gross consumption falls in the next year could determine if the target is reached.&nbsp;</p>
