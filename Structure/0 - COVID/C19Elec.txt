<p>As a result of the covid-19 lockdown, electricity use in Scotland declined significantly.&nbsp; Since lockdown, average daily electricity demand in Scotland in <strong>2020</strong> is <strong>14%</strong> <strong>lower</strong> than the equivalent period in <strong>2019</strong>.&nbsp; In <strong>2020</strong>, average daily demand is <strong>23%</strong> lower after lockdown than before.&nbsp; Even though more people are working from home, the presumed increase in domestic* consumption is more than offset by the inactivity from non-essential commercial and industrial premises.</p>
