<p><strong>The profile of electricity use has changed since lockdown</strong></p>
<p>The Scottish electricity demand data is available at a settlement period, or half-hourly level.&nbsp; The first chart shows half-hourly demand for the most recent week compared to the same period in 2020 (which is before national lockdown was imposed) and 2019.&nbsp; This shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peak demand</strong> during weekdays was similar, - <strong>4,793 MW</strong> in <strong>2021</strong> compared to <strong>4,866 MW</strong> in the same week in <strong>2019, and 4,666 MW </strong>in <strong>2020</strong>.</li>
<li>Weekend demand shows a different picture. Whilst there is usually reduced demand on weekends, the drop is more pronounced in <strong>2021</strong> compared to the two years previous.</li>
</ul>
