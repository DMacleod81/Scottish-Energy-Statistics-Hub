<p><strong>2019</strong> was a <strong>record year</strong> for <strong>renewable electricity generation</strong> in Scotland with <strong>30.5 TWh</strong> generated, <strong>15.3% up</strong> on <strong>2018</strong>. This is the equivalent of powering all households in Scotland for over three years, or charging almost 6.7 billion mobile phones for a year.</p>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation was<strong> 25.6%</strong> of the <strong>UK</strong>&rsquo;s in 2019.</p>
<p>Renewable electricity generation in between <strong>October</strong> and <strong>December 2019</strong> was in fact <strong>down</strong> by <strong>2%</strong> on <strong>Q4 2018</strong>. Even though <strong>capacity</strong> grew in this period, <strong>lower wind speeds</strong> may have contributed to the lower generation.</p>
<p>The majority of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation continues to come from <strong>wind</strong> (<strong>22.4 TWh</strong>). <strong>Offshore wind</strong> grew substantially in <strong>2019</strong>; <strong>3.3 TWh</strong> was generated last year via offshore wind, up from <strong>1.3 TWh</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>. This is due to the Beatrice wind farm off the Caithness coast becoming fully operational in May 2019.</p>
