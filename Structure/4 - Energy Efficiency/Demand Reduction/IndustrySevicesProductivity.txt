<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> sets ambitions in both the <strong>industrial</strong> and <strong>services</strong> sectors to <strong>improve</strong> <strong>energy productivity</strong> by <strong>30%</strong>, and for <strong>emissions intensity</strong> to <strong>fall</strong> by <strong>30%</strong> from a <strong>2015</strong> baseline, through a combination of fuel diversification, energy efficiency improvements and heat recovery. Energy productivity is calculated as sectoral GVA divided by energy consumption in each sector. Emissions intensity is sectoral emissions divided by GVA in each sector.</p>
<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, <strong>industrial energy productivity decreased</strong> by <strong>6.5%</strong> from the <strong>2015</strong> figure. This is mainly driven by a <strong>7.2%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>consumption</strong> in the same period.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial emissions intensity</strong> <strong>rose</strong> by <strong>4.6%</strong> from <strong>2015</strong> to <strong>2017</strong>, with industrial emissions increasing by in each of the last two years.</p>
<p><strong>Energy productivity</strong> in the <strong>services</strong> sector in 2017 is <strong>&pound;5.38 million GVA per GWh</strong>, <strong>up 3.6%</strong> compared to the baseline in <strong>2015</strong>.&nbsp; This is mainly driven by a <strong>2.4%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>GVA</strong> in the services sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Services emissions intensity</strong> <strong>fell</strong> by <strong>5.3%</strong> between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2017</strong>. Between <strong>1999</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>2017</strong> it <strong>fell</strong> by <strong>36.1%</strong>, as a result of an underlying <strong>10.3%</strong> <strong>drop</strong> in <strong>emissions</strong> and a <strong>40.4%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>GVA</strong> (2017 prices).</p>

<p>*Industrial GVA comprises the manufacturing, mining and construction sectors&rsquo;</p>
