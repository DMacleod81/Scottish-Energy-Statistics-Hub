<p>The shift towards&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;electricity generation had a profound impact on&nbsp;<strong>emissions</strong>.&nbsp; Each kilowatt hour of electricity generated in Scotland in <strong>2021</strong> added an estimated <strong>26.9&nbsp;</strong>grams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (gCO2e/kWh), a sizeable drop from <strong>389.8 gCO2e/kWh </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>. This was driven by both the <strong>increase&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>low carbon renewable generation&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>closure&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland's last&nbsp;<strong>coal power stations&nbsp;</strong>Cockenzie and Longannet in the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the fourth year running, grid intensity in Scotland is <strong>below</strong> the <strong>50 gCO2e/kWh ambition</strong> for 2020 outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a>.&nbsp; It is also substantially lower than grid intensity in the <strong>UK</strong>&nbsp;as a whole (<strong>153.6 gCO2e/kWh</strong>).&nbsp; This is due to the greater <a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-scottish-energy-statistics/?Section=RenLowCarbon&amp;Subsection=RenElec&amp;Chart=ElecGen">low carbon electricity generation</a> in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>However, grid intensity in Scotland has increased from a low of <strong>21.8 gCO2e/kWh</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp; This is due to a <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>gas</strong> used to <strong>generate electricity</strong>, compensating for a fall in nuclear generation due to long-term outages at Hunterston B.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>1998,&nbsp;</strong>Greenhouse gas&nbsp;<strong>Emissions</strong> associated with electricity generation has fallen <strong>92.7%</strong>, from&nbsp;<strong>17.8</strong>&nbsp;<strong>million tonnes</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong> to <strong>1.3</strong>&nbsp;<strong>million tonnes</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2021.&nbsp;</strong> The <strong>proportion</strong> of total emissions coming from electricity generation has <strong>fallen</strong> greatly, from <strong>21.8%</strong> in <strong>1998</strong> to <strong>3.1%</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>
