<p>The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a Government energy efficiency scheme that began operating in 2013. &nbsp;ECO delivers energy efficiency measures in homes across Great Britain in order to reduce energy costs for low income households. ECO is funded through a charge on the energy bills of all customers of regulated energy companies (currently those with over 250,000 customers).</p>
<p>From 2013 to <strong>March 2022</strong>, more than <strong>412,062 ECO measures</strong> were installed in households in Scotland, and <strong>8.9% </strong>of these met the <strong>rural </strong>sub-obligation. Over <strong>8,785</strong> measures were installed from January to <strong>March 2022</strong>.&nbsp; These were all delivered via the <strong>Affordable Warmth obligation</strong>, and <strong>12.1%</strong> of installations in this quarter met the <strong>rural</strong>&nbsp;sub-obligation.</p>
<p>In <strong>quarter 1 2022</strong>, <strong>3,116&nbsp;households</strong> were in receipt of ECO measures, meaning the <strong>total</strong> across the scheme by March 2022 stands at over <strong>313,312 households</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>12.4%</strong>&nbsp;of all&nbsp;<strong>households</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Scotland</strong>.&nbsp; Scottish households account for 13.1% of all in receipt of ECO measures in Britain, higher than Scotland's percentage share of households in Britain overall (9.2%). &emsp;</p>
