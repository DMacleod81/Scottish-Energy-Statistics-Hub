<p><strong>Electricity demand has reduced significantly</strong></p>
<p>The first chart above compares average weekday daily electricity demand pre and post lockdown for 2020, and how this compares against previous years.&nbsp; To do this, a comparison is made between the first three weeks of March (blue bars) and the subsequent weeks since lockdown (orange bars) for each year since 2013.&nbsp; It shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before lockdown, average weekday daily consumption is similar to previous years</li>
<li>After lockdown, weekday consumption dropped by <strong>22%</strong> compared to the start of March. Even though more people are working from home, the presumed increase in domestic consumption is more than offset by the inactivity from non-essential commercial and industrial premises.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The second chart above shows daily electricity demand from the start of March in 2020 (blue line) and 2019 (orange line).&nbsp; Daily demand levels are similar until Friday 20<sup>th</sup> March when pubs, clubs, restaurants and gyms closed.&nbsp; From then, electricity demand reduced and was consistently lower from the lockdown onwards.&nbsp;</p>
