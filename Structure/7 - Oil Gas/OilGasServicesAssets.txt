<p>ONS publishes analysis to quantify the economic value of Scotland&rsquo;s natural capital <strong>assets</strong>, and the value of the <strong>flow of services</strong> from these assets.&nbsp; For example, in the oil and gas context, the natural capital assets are the reserves themselves, whereas the value of the services is the profit from selling the fuels.</p>
<p>The estimated value of Scotland&rsquo;s <strong>fossil fuel</strong>* <strong>assets</strong> in <strong>2018</strong> is <strong>&pound;49.3 billion</strong>, down <strong>11.7%</strong> on <strong>2017</strong>, and down 77.0% from its <strong>peak</strong> of <strong>&pound;214.4 billion</strong> in <strong>2012</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual <strong>value of services</strong> in Scotland associated with <strong>fossil fuels</strong> was <strong>&pound;10.3 billion</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>, double the amount from 2017.&nbsp; The annual valuation of fossil fuels varies substantially over time, largely driven by oil and gas price changes and production trends.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Assets and value of services associated with coal production is included in these figures, however, this makes up less than 1% of Scotland&rsquo;s fossil fuel production.</p>
