<p>The <strong>5,632 GWh</strong> of <strong>renewable heat</strong> <strong>output</strong> in Scotland in <strong>2022 </strong>comes from <strong>2.29 GW</strong> of <strong>capacity</strong> across <strong>43,134</strong> <strong>installations</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal x_ContentPasted0"><strong>2022</strong> showed growth in overall&nbsp;<strong>renewable heat output</strong>&nbsp;(including industrial heat), with a gain of&nbsp;<strong>212 GWh</strong>. Most of this&nbsp;<strong>(83 GWh)</strong>&nbsp;came from&nbsp;<strong>biomass</strong> installations.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal x_ContentPasted0"><strong>Biomethane</strong>&nbsp;is the second largest contributor to total renewable heat output&nbsp;<strong>(16%) </strong>and increased by<strong> 52 GWh </strong>between <strong>2021</strong> and <strong>2022</strong>. Biomethane for gas grid injection is becoming increasingly common but does not add to overall heat capacity as there is no capacity associated with this technology. This is because there are no dedicated facilities built to output a fixed capacity of biomethane.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal x_ContentPasted0"><strong>Heat pumps </strong>installations have increased between <strong>2021</strong> and <strong>2022</strong>, with <strong>3,446 </strong>new installations. Heat pumps make up a relatively small share of overall output<strong>&nbsp;(11%)</strong>&nbsp;because they are mostly installed in domestic settings where capacities are likely to be small and usage throughout the year is low compared to other potential heat uses.</p>
<p>Almost half <strong>(43%,&nbsp;2,392 GWh)</strong> of renewable heat output comes from 113 <strong>large installations</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>over 1 MW</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>39,314 (91%)</strong> of the renewable heat installations are <strong>micro</strong> installations of <strong>less than 45 kW</strong>.&nbsp; It is believed that most of these will be in the domestic sector.</p>
