<p>The shift towards&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;electricity generation had a profound impact on&nbsp;<strong>emissions</strong>.&nbsp; Each kilowatt hour of electricity generated in Scotland in <strong>2018</strong> added an estimated <strong>44.6&nbsp;</strong>grams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (gCO2e/kWh), a sizeable drop from <strong>320.1 gCO2e/kWh&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;This was driven by both the&nbsp;<strong>increase&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>low carbon renewable generation&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>closure&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland's last&nbsp;<strong>coal power stations&nbsp;</strong>Cockenzie and Longannet in the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the second year running, grid intensity is <strong>below</strong> the <strong>50 gCO2e/kWh ambition</strong> for 2020 outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a>.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;grid intensity in 2018 almost doubled from <strong>24.0&nbsp;gCO2e/kWh</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp; This is due to a <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>gas</strong> used to <strong>generate electricity</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>, compensating for a fall in nuclear generation due to long-term outages at Hunterston B.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
