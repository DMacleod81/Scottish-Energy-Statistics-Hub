<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> sets ambitions in both the <strong>residential</strong> sector to for <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>emissions</strong> <strong>intensity</strong> to <strong>fall</strong> by <strong>30%</strong> from <strong>2015</strong> levels. Energy intensity is the average energy use per household in Scotland. Emissions intensity is average emissions per household.</p>
<p>From <strong>2005 </strong>to <strong>2019</strong>, <strong>energy intensity fell</strong> by <strong>24.8%</strong> to <strong>17.7 MWh. </strong>This is despite a <strong>9.7%</strong> increase in the <strong>number of households</strong> and is driven by a <strong>17.4%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in <strong>energy consumption</strong> - in part due to improved energy efficiency measures, energy intensity fell by just <strong>1.3%, </strong>despite a <strong>1.3% increase </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>domestic energy consumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2019</strong>&nbsp;<strong>emissions intensity</strong> in the residential sector <strong>decreased </strong>by just <strong>1.1%</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>2.49 tons of carbon dioxide per household</strong> a year. This stems from a <strong>1.6% increase</strong> in <strong>domestic emissions</strong> and a <strong>2.7%</strong> increase in the <strong>number of households</strong>.</p>
