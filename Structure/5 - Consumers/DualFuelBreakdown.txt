<p>Analysis of Ofgem data shows that&nbsp;<strong>wholesale costs</strong>&nbsp;accounted for&nbsp;the largest chunk of Scottish dual fuel bills, currently accounting for <strong>35.4%</strong>&nbsp;of bills of <strong>South Scotland</strong> consumers and <strong>34.2%</strong> of <strong>North Scotland</strong> consumers.&nbsp; This has <strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;since the last reporting period (<strong>31.5%</strong> and <strong>30.3%</strong> respectively for April - September 2020) as wholesale prices rise back towards pre-covid-19 pandemic levels.</p>
<p><strong>Network costs</strong> follow as the second largest component of Scottish dual fuel bills.&nbsp; It makes up a greater proportion of bills in <strong>North Scotland</strong> (<strong>25.8%</strong>) than <strong>South Scotland</strong> (<strong>23.7%</strong>), possibly as a result of greater costs distributing electricity to remote parts of Northern Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Operating costs</strong> make up approximately <strong>20%</strong> of bills in both regions, <strong>policy costs</strong> approximately <strong>16.5%.&nbsp; </strong>Both costs made up a larger proportion of the overall bill in the last five years.</p>
