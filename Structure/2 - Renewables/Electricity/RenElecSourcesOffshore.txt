<p>Offshore wind is rapidly growing in Scotland -&nbsp;<strong>capacity</strong>&nbsp;saw a five-fold increase from&nbsp;<strong>0.2 GW</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>June 2018</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>1.0&nbsp;GW</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>March 2020&nbsp;</strong>with the Beatrice wind farm in the Moray Firth becoming operational in 2019.&nbsp; This led to&nbsp;<strong>3,2 TWh</strong>&nbsp;of electricity generated via offshore wind in <strong>2019, </strong>up from <strong>1.4 TWh </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offshore wind is likely to play more of a role in the future; <strong>eleven</strong>&nbsp;offshore wind projects totalling <strong>4.2 GW</strong> are in&nbsp;<strong>development</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>F</strong><strong>ive</strong> of these (totalling <strong>1.0 GW</strong>) are currently <strong>under construction</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Electricity generation via offshore wind may have generated&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.26 billion</strong>&nbsp;in turnover in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, but has directly supported approximately&nbsp;<strong>1,700&nbsp;</strong>full-time equivalent&nbsp;<strong>jobs&nbsp;</strong>in Scotland.</p>
