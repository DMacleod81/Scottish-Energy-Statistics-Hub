<p>As in 2018, the majority of both <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>output</strong> of renewable heat in <strong>2019</strong> came from <strong>biomass</strong> primary combustion and biomass combined heat and power (CHP). Together, these technologies account for <strong>1.65 GW</strong> of <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>3,678 GWh</strong> of <strong>output</strong>. <strong>Energy from waste</strong> makes up <strong>7%</strong> of output and <strong>heat pumps 8%</strong>.</p>
<p>Almost half (<strong>44%,</strong> <strong>2,313 GWh</strong>) of renewable heat output comes from 90 large <strong>installations</strong> of <strong>over 1 MW</strong>. There are <strong>less than ten</strong> installations that <strong>generated more than 100 GWh</strong> in 2019; together these sites provided 25% (<strong>1,297 GWh</strong>) of the total renewable heat output in Scotland in <strong>2019</strong>.</p>
