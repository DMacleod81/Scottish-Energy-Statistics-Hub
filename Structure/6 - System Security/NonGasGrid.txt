<p>Scotland has an estimated <strong>14.4%</strong> of households <strong>not connected</strong> to the <strong>gas grid</strong>, and therefore do not have access to gas. This figure is similar to Great Britain as a whole, also at 14.4%.</p>
<p>The <strong>Islands </strong>are worst affected in this regard, with <strong>Orkney</strong> and the <strong>Shetlands</strong> entirely <strong>off the gas grid</strong>, and the vast majority (<strong>86.4%</strong>) of the <strong>Western Isles</strong> is off-grid. The <strong>North West </strong>tends to have a high proportion of off-grid properties, with six in ten households in the <strong>Highlands</strong> (<strong>58.2%</strong>) and half in Argyll and Bute (<strong>49.3%</strong>) off the gas grid. This, therefore, limits the choice these consumers have available in terms of how to heat their homes.</p>
