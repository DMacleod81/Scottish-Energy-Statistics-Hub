<p>As in 2017, the majority of both <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>output</strong> of renewable heat in <strong>2018</strong> came from <strong>biomass</strong> primary combustion and biomass combined heat and power (CHP). Together, these technologies account for <strong>1.66 GW</strong> of <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>3,845 GWh</strong> of <strong>output</strong>. <strong>Energy from waste</strong> makes up <strong>19.6%</strong> of output and <strong>heat pumps 6.5%</strong>.</p>
<p>Almost half (<strong>46.8%,</strong> <strong>2,450 GWh</strong>) of renewable heat output comes from 100 large <strong>installations</strong> of <strong>over 1 MW</strong>. There are <strong>seven</strong> installations that <strong>generated more than 100 GWh</strong> in 2018; together these sites provided 30% (<strong>1,571 GWh</strong>) of the total renewable heat output in Scotland in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
