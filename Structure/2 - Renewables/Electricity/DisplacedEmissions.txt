<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>2000</strong>, Scottish renewables have&nbsp;<strong>displaced&nbsp;</strong>an estimated&nbsp;<strong>151 million tonnes&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;across the GB system, assuming that the same amount of electricity would have been generated by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2019&nbsp;</strong>alone, Scottish renewable electricity displaced an estimated&nbsp;<strong>13.5 million tonnes of CO2.</strong>&nbsp; For context, this is equivalent to <strong>28%</strong> of Scotland&rsquo;s total <strong>greenhouse gas emissions</strong> in 2019 (47.8 million tonnes of CO2).&nbsp; The estimate of carbon displacement has steadily <strong>risen</strong> since 2016, primarily due to the increase in<strong> renewable electricity generated</strong> in Scotland.</p>
