<p>In 2020, it is estimated that the low carbon and renewable energy (LCRE)* sector <strong>directly </strong>employed <strong>20,500 </strong>full-time equivalent <strong>jobs </strong>in Scotland. This represents around <strong>10% </strong>of employment in the <strong>UK </strong>LCRE sector. Most of this is made up of staff employed in <strong>energy efficiency </strong>(<strong>8,400 </strong>full-time equivalent staff) and <strong>low carbon electricity </strong>(<strong>9,000</strong>)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, it is estimated that the Scottish low carbon and renewable energy economy directly generated <strong>&pound;5.5 billion</strong>. The <strong>renewable energy </strong>part of the LCRE sector is particularly important in Scotland where it accounts for around half of <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s low-carbon turnover</strong>. In contrast, renewable energy accounts for around a third<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of LCRE turnover in the <strong>UK </strong>as a whole.</p>
<p>There has been strong growth in <strong>exports</strong> by low-carbon businesses in Scotland; rising from an estimated <strong>&pound;225.5 million</strong> in <strong>2015</strong> to an estimated <strong>&pound;384.5 million</strong> in <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
