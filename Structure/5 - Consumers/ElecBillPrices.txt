<p>Electricity prices have increased, in cash terms,&nbsp;each year since 2017 for <strong>direct debit</strong> (<strong>up 29.8% </strong>from <strong>2017</strong>), <strong>standard credit </strong>consumers (<strong>up 29.1%</strong> from <strong>2017</strong>) and <strong>prepayment </strong>customers (<strong>up 30.0%</strong> from <strong>2017)</strong>; <strong>Direct Debit </strong>customers now pay on average the <strong>lowest</strong> <strong>electricity bills</strong> in Scotland, <strong>9.7% lower</strong> than <strong>standard credit</strong> customers who pay the most, and <strong>3.5% lower</strong> than <strong>prepayment</strong> customers.</p>
<p>There are substantial differences in electricity prices between North and South Scotland* &ndash; overall, <strong>North Scotland </strong>residents are paying on average <strong>4.1% </strong>a year <strong>more </strong>than <strong>South Scotland </strong>residents, and pay the second highest electricity bills of all regions in the UK, behind Merseyside and North Wales. This is likely to be a result of greater costs distributing electricity to remote parts of Northern Scotland.&nbsp; Electricity bills for <strong>South Scotland</strong> residents tend to be <strong>similar</strong> to the <strong>UK</strong> as a whole.</p>
