<p>Scotland had <strong>14.5 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in March 2023</strong>. This is a 8.1% increase from March 2022. This is due to increases in onshore and offshore wind capacity over the course of 2022. &nbsp;Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>9.3 GW</strong>). <strong>Offshore wind</strong> capacity more than doubled over the course of 2022 and has continuedto increase, from 0.9 GW in December 2021 to <strong>2.3 GW</strong> in <strong>March 2023.</strong></p>
<p>Half of the renewable capacity in Scotland comes from <strong>large installations</strong> of over 50 MW (<strong>8.1 GW</strong> in total).&nbsp; However, a total of <strong>1.3 GW</strong> comes from <strong>small-scale installations</strong> of less than 5 MW.&nbsp; These projects are important as they are likely to contribute to the development of smart, decentralised and local energy markets in Scotland.&nbsp; This is made up of <strong>0.4 GW </strong>of <strong>onshore wind</strong>, <strong>0.4 GW </strong>of <strong>solar PV</strong>, <strong>0.4 GW </strong>of <strong>hydro</strong> and <strong>0.1 GW </strong>of <strong>bioenergy and waste</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
