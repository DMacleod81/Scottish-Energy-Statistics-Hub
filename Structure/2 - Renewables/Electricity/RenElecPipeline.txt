<p>As of <strong>March 2023, 433 </strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>21.9 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. <strong>4.0 GW</strong> of these are <strong>under construction</strong>, most of which are <strong>offshore wind</strong> farms off the Moray Firth.&nbsp; <strong>6.1 GW </strong>are awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and<strong> 11.9 GW in planning</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were all capacity in the pipeline to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed, and could generate an estimated <strong>53.8 TWh </strong>of renewable electricity. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors that mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
