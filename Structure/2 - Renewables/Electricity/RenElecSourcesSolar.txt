<p>While&nbsp;<strong>solar&nbsp;photovoltaics (PV) capacity&nbsp;</strong>in Scotland increased rapidly in the first half of this decade (<strong>2 MW&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2010&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>326 MW&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2016</strong>),&nbsp;<strong>progress&nbsp;</strong>has&nbsp;<strong>slowed&nbsp;</strong>in recent years, rising slightly to&nbsp;<strong>365 MW&nbsp;</strong>by <strong>March 2020</strong>.&nbsp; As of <strong>2018</strong>, there were over <strong>58,000</strong> solar PV installations in Scotland.&nbsp; Solar PV generated&nbsp;<strong>347 GWh&nbsp;</strong>of electricity in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, enough to power almost <strong>89,000 Scottish homes&nbsp;</strong>for a year.&nbsp; There is a further&nbsp;<strong>382 MW&nbsp;</strong>of solar projects in the pipeline as of March 2020.&nbsp;</p>
