<p><strong>The profile of electricity use has changed since lockdown</strong></p>
<p>The Scottish electricity demand data is available at a settlement period, or half-hourly level.&nbsp; The first chart shows half-hourly demand for the most recent week compared to the same period last year.&nbsp; This shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The typical morning electricity &ldquo;peak&rdquo; has flattened out, as electrical showers, kettles, lights and heating are spread over a slightly longer period.</li>
<li><strong>Peak demand</strong> is lower than normal - <strong>3.2 GW</strong> in <strong>2020</strong> compared to <strong>3.4 GW</strong> in the same week in <strong>2019</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we progress through lockdown, electricity demand between the years has got closer, however this is as a result of the normal decrease in demand into the summer in 2019 rather than an increase in 2020 from loosening of lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>The profile of weekday demand more closely resembles weekend demand since lockdown.&nbsp; Given that, in normal times, industrial and commercial demand is lower at weekends, this seems to confirm a reduction of activity in those sectors in daytime hours during the week.</p>
