<p>Using average consumption data by local authority and the average variable unit and fixed cost for North and South Scotland, it is possible to estimate what an average energy bill cost is for households in each local authority. This reveals large differences in energy bills across Scotland; <strong>Argyll and Bute</strong> have the <strong>highest</strong> energy bills (<strong>&pound;1,842</strong> for electricity and gas) and <strong>Glasgow City</strong> the <strong>lowest</strong> (<strong>&pound;1,113</strong>), 40% lower. <strong>Shetland Islands</strong> have on average the <strong>highest electricity</strong> bills (<strong>&pound;1,717</strong>), although this is likely to be because Shetland is reliant on electricity for heating more than other local authorities. <strong>East Renfrewshire</strong> has the <strong>highest</strong> average <strong>gas</strong> bill (<strong>&pound;721</strong>).</p>
