<p>Electricity prices have risen substantially in real teams for all Scottish consumers compared to the early 2000s, with direct debit customer prices increasing by over 75% from its lowest point in 2003. Prices had <strong>stabilised</strong>, however, in <strong>2019 </strong>they <strong>increased </strong>each year for the last three years for <strong>direct debit</strong> (<strong>up 20.3%</strong> in real terms from <strong>2016</strong>) and <strong>standard credit </strong>consumers (up <strong>18.6%</strong> from <strong>2016</strong>). Prices for <strong>prepayment </strong>customers remained <strong>steady</strong> in this period (increasing by 0.1%); this may be a result of <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/gas/retail-market/market-review-and-reform/implementation-cma-remedies/prepayment-price-cap">Ofgem&rsquo;s prepayment price cap</a> that came into force in April 2017. As such, <strong>prepayment</strong> customers now pay on average the <strong>lowest</strong> <strong>electricity bills</strong> in Scotland, <strong>16.1% lower</strong> (based on 2010 prices) less than <strong>standard credit</strong> customers who pay the most.</p>
<p>There are substantial differences in electricity prices between North and South Scotland* &ndash; overall, <strong>North Scotland </strong>residents are paying on average <strong>6.0% </strong>a year <strong>more </strong>than <strong>South Scotland </strong>residents. This is likely to be a result of greater costs distributing electricity to remote parts of Northern Scotland.</p>
<p>Prices in Scotland as a whole though are <strong>slightly higher </strong>than prices for <strong>customers </strong>in <strong>England </strong>and <strong>Wales </strong>across all customer types.</p>
