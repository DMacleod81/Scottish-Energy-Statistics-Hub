<p>For energy supplies to remain secure, the system must be able to meet <strong>demand </strong>at <strong>peak times</strong>. Hence <strong>seasonality </strong>is key as demand is <strong>higher </strong>in the <strong>winter </strong>than the <strong>summer</strong>. The chart illustrates this, showing Scotland&rsquo;s energy use on a daily basis from 2013. It shows that <strong>seasonal variations </strong>in the demand for <strong>electricity </strong>are much <strong>smaller </strong>than they are for <strong>gas</strong>.</p>
<p>During the winter of 2021/22 <strong>the peak daily demand</strong> for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>gas</strong></span> was <strong>423GWh </strong>(on 26<sup>th</sup> December 2021). This was more than <strong>seven times greater </strong>than the minimum gas demand in summer 2021 (<strong>55 GWh </strong>on 26<sup>th</sup> August 2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021/22, <strong>peak <span style="text-decoration: underline;">electricity</span> daily demand </strong>(<strong>99 GWh</strong>, on the 8<sup>th</sup> December 2021) was <strong>double </strong>that of <strong>minimum </strong>demand (<strong>52&nbsp;GWh</strong> on the 13<sup>th</sup> June 2021).&nbsp; The <strong>peak half-hourly demand</strong> for <strong>electricity</strong> was <strong>5.1 GW</strong> at 12:30pm on 8th December 2021.</p>
