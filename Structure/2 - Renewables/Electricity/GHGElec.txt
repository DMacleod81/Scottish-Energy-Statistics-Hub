<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>1998,&nbsp;</strong>Greenhouse gas&nbsp;<strong>Emissions</strong>&nbsp;associated with electricity generation has fallen&nbsp;<strong>87.9%</strong>, from&nbsp;<strong>17.8</strong>&nbsp;<strong>million tonnes</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>2.2</strong>&nbsp;<strong>million tonnes</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018.&nbsp;</strong>This has been almost entirely driven by a reduction in emissions from power stations.</p>
<p>However, between&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;electricity emissions&nbsp;<strong>almost doubled</strong>. This follows long-term outages at Hunterson B leading to&nbsp;<strong>reduced nuclear generation</strong>, which was replaced with an&nbsp;<strong>increase&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;being used to&nbsp;<strong>generate electricity</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>proportion</strong> of total emissions coming from electricity generation has <strong>fallen</strong> greatly, from <strong>23.5%</strong> in <strong>1998</strong> to <strong>5.2%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
