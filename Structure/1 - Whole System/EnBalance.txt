<p>We can represent Scotland&rsquo;s entire energy system as an <strong>energy balance, </strong>represented as a <strong>Sankey </strong>diagram. This provides a global picture of energy in Scotland, showing the flow from <strong>inputs </strong>(indigenous production and imports), to <strong>transformation </strong>to <strong>outputs </strong>(exports, losses and consumption). The widths of the bands are proportional to the size of the flow they represent.</p>
<p>It shows Scotland indigenously produces a vast amount of energy, and the majority of Scotland&rsquo;s energy is eventually exported.</p>
<p>In <strong>2020</strong>, Scotland&rsquo;s total input to the energy system, or primary energy, was <strong>1,172 TWh</strong>, falling for the first time in five years. <strong>Indigenous production makes up 83.4%</strong> of this and <strong>16.5% </strong>from <strong>imports</strong>. The vast majority (<strong>90.7%</strong>) of primary energy is from <strong>oil and gas, 1,063 TWh, up 1.1% on 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of <strong>outputs</strong>, <strong>79.4% </strong>of all primary energy was <strong>exported in 2020</strong>, <strong>8.8% </strong>was lost in <strong>transformation </strong>and <strong>11.7% </strong>is accounted for by end use <strong>consumption </strong>in Scotland.</p>
