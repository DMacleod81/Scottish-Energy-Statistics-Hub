<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> sets ambitions in both the <strong>industrial</strong> and <strong>services</strong> sectors to <strong>improve</strong> <strong>energy productivity</strong> by <strong>30%</strong>, and for <strong>emissions intensity</strong> to <strong>fall</strong> by <strong>30%</strong> from a <strong>2015</strong> baseline, through a combination of fuel diversification, energy efficiency improvements and heat recovery. Energy productivity is calculated as sectoral GVA divided by energy consumption in each sector. Emissions intensity is sectoral emissions divided by GVA in each sector.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial energy productivity </strong>in Scotland stands at <strong>&pound;0.65 million GVA per GWh </strong>in <strong>2021.&nbsp; </strong>This moved from <strong>12.9% below </strong>the <strong>baseline </strong>in <strong>2020 </strong>to <strong>4.8%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>above</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>2021</strong>.&nbsp; This is mainly driven by a <strong>10.2%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>decrease&nbsp;</strong>in <strong>consumption</strong> between 2015 and 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Industrial emissions intensity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>decrease </strong>by <strong>4.2%</strong> from <strong>2015</strong> to <strong>2021 </strong>to <strong>384 tonnes of CO2/&pound; million GVA.&nbsp; </strong>This is a <strong>17.4% decrease </strong>from <strong>2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Energy productivity</strong> in the <strong>services</strong> sector in <strong>2021</strong>&nbsp;is <strong>&pound;4.54 million GVA per GWh</strong>, <strong>up 4.1%</strong> compared to the baseline in <strong>2015</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Services emissions intensity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>decreased </strong>by <strong>3.3%</strong> between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2021 </strong>to <strong>29&nbsp;tonnes of CO2/&pound; million GVA</strong>. A <strong>5.0% drop</strong> in <strong>emissions</strong> in the services sector contributed to this along with the drop in GVA in the services sector mentioned above.</p>

<p>*Industrial GVA comprises the manufacturing, mining and construction sectors&rsquo;</p>
