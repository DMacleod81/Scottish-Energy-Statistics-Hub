<p>In 2021, it is estimated that the low carbon and renewable energy (LCRE)* sector <strong>directly </strong>employed <strong>28,300 </strong>full-time equivalent <strong>jobs </strong>in Scotland. This represents around <strong>11% </strong>of employment in the <strong>UK </strong>LCRE sector. Most of this is made up of staff employed in <strong>energy efficiency </strong>(<strong>9800 </strong>full-time equivalent staff) and <strong>low carbon electricity </strong>(<strong>11,200</strong>)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, it is estimated that the Scottish low carbon and renewable energy economy directly generated <strong>&pound;8.7 billion</strong>. The <strong>renewable energy </strong>part of the LCRE sector is particularly important in Scotland where it accounts for around <strong>70%</strong> of <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s low-carbon and renewable energy turnover</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been strong growth in <strong>exports</strong> by low-carbon businesses in Scotland, particularly in the latest year; rising from an estimated <strong>&pound;0.2 billion</strong> in <strong>2015</strong> to an estimated <strong>&pound;1.3 billion</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>
