<p>The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a UK Government scheme set up to encourage uptake of renewable heat technologies amongst householders, communities and businesses through financial incentives. The domestic scheme launched in April 2014.</p>
<p>By <strong>September 2022</strong>, there were <strong>20,857 </strong>accredited domestic RHI applications in Scotland, <strong>up 0.8%</strong> on <strong>June 2022</strong>. This is <strong>18.4%</strong> of all accredited domestic applications in GB. More than half (<strong>67.1%</strong>) of accredited applications are for <strong>air source heat pumps</strong>, and of all technologies, this has had the biggest increase in applications in the last twelve months. <strong>Biomass</strong> makes up just under a fifth (<strong>17.6%</strong>) of all accredited applications.</p>
<p>The majority of full accreditations are for buildings <strong>off the gas grid</strong> -<strong> 86.5%</strong> by December 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scotland has <strong>1.7 TWh</strong> of heat paid for under the domestic scheme as of <strong>September 2022</strong>.</p>
