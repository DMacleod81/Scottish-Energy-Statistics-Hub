<p><strong>Targets </strong>were set for <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/renewable-and-low-carbon-energy/local-and-small-scale-renewables/">community and locally-owned renewables</a> with the aim of having <strong>1 GW </strong>of capacity by <strong>2020 </strong>and <strong>2 GW </strong>by <strong>2030</strong>.</p>
<p>As of June <strong>2022</strong>, <strong>908 MW </strong>of community and locally owned capacity is operational. This has increased by 19 MW since 2021, and has nearly tripled from June <strong>2012 </strong>when capacity was <strong>321 MW</strong>.</p>
<p>The majority of operational community and locally-owned renewable capacity in Scotland in June <strong>2022 </strong>was from <strong>wind </strong>turbines (<strong>338 MW</strong>), followed by <strong>biomass </strong>(<strong>277 MW</strong>). These two technologies account for approximately 70% of overall operational capacity in June 2022.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, community and locally owned renewable energy installations identified here could be expected to produce <strong>1,933 GWh </strong>of renewable energy - <strong>1,054 GWh </strong>of <strong>electricity </strong>and <strong>668 GWh </strong>of <strong>heat</strong>. This is enough to <strong>power </strong>almost <strong>257,000 </strong>Scottish <strong>homes </strong>and is the equivalent of <strong>heating </strong>around <strong>56,000 </strong>Scottish homes <strong>with gas for a year</strong>.</p>
<p>Projects totalling more than <strong>2,411 MW </strong>are in development, including <strong>42 MW under construction </strong>and a further <strong>186 MW consented</strong> but not built. If all consented projects were operational (and there is no guarantee they will), capacity would exceed the 2020 target.</p>
