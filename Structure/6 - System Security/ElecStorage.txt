<p><strong>Electricity storage</strong> is another important source of flexibility as it will allow us to maximise the amount of renewable electricity we generate and deploy it when it is most needed.</p>
<p>By <strong>June 2022</strong>, Scotland has <strong>864 MW </strong>of <strong>storage available</strong>, the vast <strong>majority </strong>of this from the <strong>pumped hydro </strong>plants at Cruachan and Dinorwig. At least <strong>124 MW </strong>of <strong>battery </strong>storage is currently operational.</p>
<p>There is over <strong>9.0 GW</strong> of storage projects <strong>in planning </strong>or <strong>awaiting construction</strong>. Most of this comes from&nbsp; <strong>battery storage </strong>projects with a combined capacity of <strong>5.5&nbsp;GW</strong>. There are a number of <strong>pumped hydro</strong> projects in the pipeline also, totalling <strong>3.5&nbsp;GW </strong>if all eventually became operational.</p>
