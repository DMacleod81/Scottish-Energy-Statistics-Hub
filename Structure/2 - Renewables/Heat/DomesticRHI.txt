<p>The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a UK Government scheme set up to encourage uptake of renewable heat technologies amongst householders, communities and businesses through financial incentives. The domestic scheme launched in April 2014.</p>
<p>By <strong>January 2022</strong>, there were <strong>18,530</strong>&nbsp;accredited domestic RHI applications in Scotland, <strong>up 11.8%</strong> on <strong>January 2021</strong>. This is <strong>18.5%</strong> of all accredited domestic applications in GB. More than half (<strong>63.9%</strong>) of accredited applications are for <strong>air source heat pumps</strong>, and of all technologies, this has had the biggest increase in applications in the last twelve months. <strong>Biomass</strong> makes up just over a fifth (<strong>20.1%</strong>) of all accredited applications.</p>
<p>The majority of full accreditations are for buildings <strong>off the gas grid</strong> -<strong> 86.5%</strong> by December 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scotland has <strong>1.4 TWh</strong> of heat paid for under the domestic scheme as of <strong>June 2021</strong>.</p>
