<p>While&nbsp;<strong>solar&nbsp;photovoltaics (PV) capacity&nbsp;</strong>in Scotland increased rapidly in the first half of this decade (<strong>2 MW&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2010&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>326 MW&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2016</strong>),&nbsp;<strong>progress&nbsp;</strong>has&nbsp;<strong>slowed&nbsp;</strong>in recent years, rising slightly to&nbsp;<strong>379 MW </strong>by <strong>March 2021</strong>.&nbsp; This may be due to the closure of the Renewables Obligation accreditation to all solar in March 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of <strong>2019</strong>, there were over <strong>61,000</strong> solar PV installations in Scotland.&nbsp; Solar PV generated&nbsp;<strong>353 GWh </strong>of electricity in&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>, enough to power more than <strong>90,000 Scottish homes </strong>for a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a further&nbsp;<strong>352 MW&nbsp;</strong>of solar projects in the <strong>pipeline</strong> as of March 2021.&nbsp;</p>
