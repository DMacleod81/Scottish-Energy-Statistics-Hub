<p>For <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/state-energy-market-2019">Ofgem&rsquo;s State of the Market report</a>, consumer <strong>engagement</strong> is defined as any customer that has either <strong>switched supplier, changed tariff, or compared tariffs</strong> in the last <strong>twelve months</strong>.&nbsp; As per <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/consumer-survey-2019">Ofgem's&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>&nbsp;Consumer Engagement Survey</a>, <strong>45%</strong> of <strong>Scottish consumers</strong> are <strong>engaged</strong> with <strong>energy</strong> as per Ofgem&rsquo;s definition, rising from <strong>35%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp; Current levels of engagement are similar to <strong>GB</strong> as a whole (<strong>49%</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chimes with Ofgem's statistics around switching.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between January and&nbsp;<strong>December 2019</strong>, switching rate for electricity and gas in Scotland was&nbsp;<strong>20.3%</strong>, a steady increase from&nbsp;<strong>14.0%</strong>&nbsp;in the twelve months ending&nbsp;<strong>May 2017</strong>.&nbsp; The switching rate is now on par with&nbsp;<strong>Britain</strong>&nbsp;as a whole (<strong>20.5%</strong>), whereas back in&nbsp;<strong>May 2017</strong>, switching was&nbsp;<strong>2.7 percentage points higher</strong>&nbsp;in GB.&nbsp; Switching is consistently higher in&nbsp;<strong>South Scotland</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>21.2%</strong>&nbsp;in the twelve months ending December 2019) than&nbsp;<strong>North Scotland</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>18.1%</strong>).</p>
<p>Even though the proportion of Scottish consumers switching is matching GB levels, there remains a third (<strong>33%</strong>) of consumers in Scotland who have&nbsp;<strong>never switched</strong>&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;supplier according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/consumer-survey-2019">Ofgem's&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>&nbsp;Consumer Engagement Survey</a>.&nbsp; This is higher than&nbsp;<strong>27%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Britain</strong>&nbsp;as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for&nbsp;<strong>barriers</strong>&nbsp;to switching, the survey reveals that&nbsp;<strong>49%</strong>&nbsp;of Scottish people think that switching is a&nbsp;<strong>hassle</strong>&nbsp;they don&rsquo;t have time for and&nbsp;<strong>46%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>worry</strong>&nbsp;that if they switch things will&nbsp;<strong>go wrong</strong>.&nbsp; Agreement is higher for both in Scotland than GB as a whole, which may explain the greater reluctance to switch in Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the proportion who have never switched in Scotland has fallen from&nbsp;<strong>46%</strong>&nbsp;as reported in the&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;survey, suggesting engagement is increasing. &nbsp;</p>
