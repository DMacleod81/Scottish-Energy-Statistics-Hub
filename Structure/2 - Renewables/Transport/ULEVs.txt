<p>The Scottish Government has announced <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">its intention</a> to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, and has supported adoption of <strong>ultra-low emission vehicles</strong> (ULEVs). This term refers to electric, plug-in hybrid, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and all vehicles with tail-pipe emissions below 75 g/km of CO2.</p>
<p>As of <strong>December 2020</strong>, there were <strong>26,189 </strong>ULEVs licenced in Scotland. Even though ULEVs only make up <strong>0.9% </strong>of all vehicles licenced in Scotland, <strong>growth </strong>has been <strong>rapid</strong>; compared to twelve months prior, ULEVs licenced <strong>rose</strong> by <strong>62.6%</strong>.</p>
<p>The growth of ULEVs can be further illustrated by looking at the proportion of ULEVs <strong>registered for the first time</strong>. This increased from <strong>0.2% </strong>of all newly registered vehicles in the <strong>first quarter</strong> of <strong>2014 </strong>to <strong>10.5%</strong> in <strong>Q4 2020</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">As of <strong>July 2021</strong>, there were <strong>2,565</strong> public EV <strong>charge points</strong>, and <strong>657</strong> rapid chargers in Scotland. In <strong>2019,</strong> the ChargePlace Scotland network (CPS), which accounts for the majority of public charging in Scotland, recorded almost <strong>647,000</strong> separate <strong>charging events</strong>, with <strong>7.68 GWh</strong> provided. </span></p>
