<p>The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a Government energy efficiency scheme that began operating in 2013. &nbsp;ECO delivers energy efficiency measures in homes across Great Britain in order to reduce energy costs for low income households. ECO is funded through a charge on the energy bills of all customers of regulated energy companies (currently those with over 250,000 customers).</p>
<p>From 2013 to <strong>March 2020</strong>, more than&nbsp;<strong>345,000</strong>&nbsp;ECO&nbsp;<strong>measures</strong>&nbsp;were installed in households in Scotland.&nbsp;Almost <strong>8,500</strong>&nbsp;measures were installed from&nbsp;<strong>January </strong>to&nbsp;<strong>March 2020 </strong>&ndash; more than the same period in 2019 even though this end of this quarter coincided with the Covid-19 lockdown.&nbsp; All were delivered via the&nbsp;<strong>Affordable Warmth obligation</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>17.2%</strong>&nbsp;of which met the&nbsp;<strong>rural</strong>&nbsp;sub-obligation.</p>
<p>In <strong>quarter 1 2020</strong>, <strong>4,585 households</strong> were in receipt of ECO measures, meaning the <strong>total</strong> across the scheme by March 2020 stands at&nbsp;<strong>282,759 households</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>11.4%</strong>&nbsp;of all&nbsp;<strong>households</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Scotland</strong>.&nbsp; Scottish households account for 13.5% of all in receipt of ECO measures in Britain, higher than Scotland's percentage share of households in Britain overall (9.2%). &emsp;</p>
