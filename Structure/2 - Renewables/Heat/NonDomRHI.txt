<p>The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a UK Government scheme set up to encourage uptake of renewable heat technologies amongst householders, communities and businesses through financial incentives. The non-domestic scheme launched in November 2011.</p>
<p>As of <strong>July 2020</strong>, <strong>3,855</strong>&nbsp;accredited full applications were made, with <strong>127</strong>&nbsp;applications made in the preceding twelve months.&nbsp; More than three quarters of the accredited full applications are from buildings <strong>off the gas grid</strong> (<strong>77.6%</strong>&nbsp;as of December 2019).&nbsp; Capacity of accredited applications more than quadrupled from <strong>250 MW</strong> in <strong>February 2015</strong> to <strong>1.04 GW</strong> in <strong>July 2020</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>9.5 TWh</strong> of heat was generated under the non-domestic scheme as of <strong>May 2020</strong>. <strong>Biomass</strong> boilers account for the majority of this (<strong>69.4%</strong>), with <strong>23.0%</strong> of all generation from <strong>biomethane</strong> injected into the <strong>gas grid</strong>.</p>
