<p>For <strong>gas</strong>, demand is <strong>secured </strong>at a <strong>GB level</strong>. GB supplies come from a mixture of North Sea gas fields and imported supplies from pipelines within continental Europe, or from liquefied natural gas from international markets.</p>
<p><strong>Gas </strong>physically <strong>consumed </strong>in <strong>Scotland </strong>currently comes entirely from gas that flows into the <strong>St Fergus gas terminal </strong>in Aberdeenshire - approximately <strong>238 TWh </strong>in <strong>2019.&nbsp; </strong>This is down from <strong>292 TWh </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>. Gas from St Fergus is more than ample to account for Scotland&rsquo;s gas demand, which comprises a quarter (<strong>26.2%</strong>) of all of St Fergus&rsquo; gas.</p>
<p>Imports and domestic supply that are distributed from <strong>St Fergus </strong>accounts for <strong>26.3%</strong> of all of <strong>UK&rsquo;s gas </strong>in <strong>2019</strong>, down from <strong>33.5% </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
