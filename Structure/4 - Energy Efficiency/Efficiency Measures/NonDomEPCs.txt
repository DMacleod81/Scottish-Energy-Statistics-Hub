<p>For non-domestic properties, EPC bands present the calculated greenhouse gas <strong>emissions</strong> for a building on a scale from A to G. The underlying rating therefore reflects the energy efficiency of building elements (e.g. building fabric), the types of fuel used and heating, lighting and ventilation demand standardised by a combination of building type and activity. It can therefore vary considerably both within and between building types. The current non-domestic EPC rating approach is not comparable with domestic, and is more useful as an indicator of overall emissions than how a building performs compared to other buildings of a different building type</p>
<p>The Scottish Government published an analysis of non-domestic EPCs in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-non-domestic-energy-efficiency-baseline/pages/3/">Scottish Government&rsquo;s Non-Domestic Energy Efficiency Baseline</a> in December 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp; It shows that just <strong>13.5% </strong>of <strong>non-domestic </strong>buildings have an <strong>EPC</strong> rating of <strong>C or above</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are big differences between the emissions generated by different types of non-domestic properties in Scotland - <strong>storage and distribution</strong> and <strong>education </strong>buildings tend to have lower emissions (<strong>39.1% </strong>and <strong>37.0% </strong>respectively at EPC band C or above), whereas <strong>hotels </strong>(<strong>1.5%</strong>) and <strong>restaurants</strong>, <strong>cafes </strong>and <strong>takeaways </strong>(<strong>0.5%</strong>) tend towards higher emissions. There will be related differences in energy performance due both to how good the building fabric and services are and to the underlying energy demand for a building of that type.</p>
<p>EPC ratings for <strong>industrial </strong>buildings are similar to the non-domestic sector as a whole, with <strong>15.0% </strong>at least at <strong>band C</strong>.</p>
