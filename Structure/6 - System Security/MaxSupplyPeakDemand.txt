<p>As electricity networks operate across Britain as a whole, Scotland&rsquo;s security of supply in its own right is interconnected with the bigger picture of <strong>security of supply</strong> across <strong>Britain</strong>. This is measured via the <strong>loss of load expectation </strong>(LOLE)&nbsp;- this refers to the average number of hours in a year when it is expected that the market alone will not deliver sufficient supplies of electricity to meet demand, and the Electricity System Operator will have to intervene to balance the system. In their <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/203051/download">Winter Outlook Report</a>, National Grid forecast LOLE as <strong>less than 0.1 hours</strong> per year,&nbsp;well <strong>below</strong> the <strong>reliability standard</strong> of <strong>three hours</strong> per year.</p>
<p>We can look at security of supply in Scotland by looking at the supply capability of the system which can be relied on at times of high demand. As such, the analysis here <strong><u>excludes</u> intermittent renewable generators</strong> including <strong>wind </strong>and <strong>solar</strong>.</p>
<p>Discounting these, Scotland had a maximum supply capacity of <strong>9.0 GW </strong>available in <strong>2021/22</strong>. This breaks down as <strong>4.6 GW </strong>of non-intermittent generation in Scotland and <strong>4.5 GW </strong>of import capability. The main sources of domestic generation capacity are: <strong>&nbsp;1.2 GW</strong> from <strong>nuclear </strong>(from Hunterston B and Torness), <strong>1.3 GW </strong>of <strong>large hydro </strong>plants, almost <strong>1.2 GW </strong>from <strong>gas </strong>(Peterhead) and <strong>0.7 GW </strong>of <strong>pumped hydro </strong>(Cruachan and Foyers)<strong>. </strong>The <strong>secure import capability </strong>consists of <strong>0.5 GW </strong>of capacity available on the <strong>Moyle interconnector</strong> from Northern Ireland and <strong>3.9 GW </strong>of on transmission networks from <strong>England and Wales</strong>. This import capacity refers to what <em>could</em> still be safely imported following major faults on the electricity system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a security of supply perspective the important comparison is maximum capacity with the level of <strong>peak demand</strong>. In the chart, the <strong>maximum supply capacity </strong>is plotted against the <strong>peak demand </strong>for each year. Scotland&rsquo;s electricity system remained <strong>secure </strong>in each year in terms of having confidence that we can meet peak demand. Scotland&rsquo;s peak demand in winter <strong>2021/22</strong> was<strong> 5.0&nbsp;GW</strong>, comfortably within <strong>maximum supply capacity </strong>of <strong>9.0 GW</strong>.</p>
