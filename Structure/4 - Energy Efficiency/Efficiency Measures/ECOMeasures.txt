<p>The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a Government energy efficiency scheme that began operating in 2013. &nbsp;ECO delivers energy efficiency measures in homes across Great Britain in order to reduce energy costs for low income households. ECO is funded through a charge on the energy bills of all customers of regulated energy companies (currently those with over 250,000 customers).</p>
<p>From 2013 to the end of <strong>2019</strong>, almost <strong>337,000</strong> ECO <strong>measures</strong> were installed in households in Scotland, <strong>12.6%</strong> of all measures nationally. <strong>9,810</strong> measures were installed from <strong>October </strong>to <strong>December 2019</strong>.&nbsp; All were delivered via the <strong>Affordable Warmth obligation</strong>, <strong>15.7%</strong> of which met the <strong>rural</strong> sub-obligation.</p>
<p>In total, more than <strong>278,000 households</strong> in Scotland were in receipt of ECO measures by <strong>December 2019</strong>.&nbsp; This is around <strong>13.5%</strong> of all <strong>households</strong> in <strong>Scotland</strong>, higher than Scotland&rsquo;s overall share of GB households (9.2%). In <strong>quarter 4 2019</strong>, <strong>5,270</strong> households were in receipt of ECO measures.</p>â€ƒ
