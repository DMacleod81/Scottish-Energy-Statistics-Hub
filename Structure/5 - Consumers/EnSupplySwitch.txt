<p>Fostering the idea that consumers have choice with their suppliers and take a proactive approach with energy is a key aspect of consumer engagement. <strong>Switching</strong> is a key aspect of this.</p>
<p>Between January and&nbsp;<strong>December 2019</strong>, switching rate for electricity and gas in Scotland was&nbsp;<strong>20.3%</strong>, a steady increase from&nbsp;<strong>14.0%</strong>&nbsp;in the twelve months ending&nbsp;<strong>May 2017</strong>.&nbsp; The switching rate is now on par with&nbsp;<strong>Britain</strong>&nbsp;as a whole (<strong>20.5%</strong>), whereas back in&nbsp;<strong>May 2017</strong>, switching was&nbsp;<strong>2.7 percentage points higher</strong>&nbsp;in GB.&nbsp; Switching is consistently higher in&nbsp;<strong>South Scotland</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>21.2%</strong>&nbsp;in the twelve months ending December 2019) than&nbsp;<strong>North Scotland</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>18.1%</strong>).</p>
<p>Even though the proportion of Scottish consumers switching is matching GB levels, there remains a third (<strong>33%</strong>) of consumers in Scotland who have <strong>never switched</strong> <strong>electricity</strong> or <strong>gas</strong> supplier according to <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/consumer-survey-2019">Ofgem's <strong>2019</strong> Consumer Engagement Survey</a>.&nbsp; This is higher than <strong>27%</strong> in <strong>Britain</strong> as a whole.&nbsp; However, the proportion who have never switched in Scotland has fallen from <strong>46%</strong> as reported in the <strong>2018</strong> survey, suggesting increasing engagement.</p>
