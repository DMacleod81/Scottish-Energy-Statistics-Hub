<p>Scotland had <strong>11.9 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in March 2020</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, however, has levelled off since June 2019.&nbsp; Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>8.4 GW</strong>), with <strong>offshore wind</strong> capacity growing rapidly (<strong>1.0 GW</strong>).</p>
<p>About half of the renewable capacity in Scotland comes from <strong>large installations</strong> of over 50 MW (<strong>5.6 GW</strong> in total).&nbsp; However, a total of <strong>2.3 GW</strong> comes from <strong>small-scale installations</strong> of less than 5 MW.&nbsp; These projects are important as they are likely to contribute to the development of smart, decentralised and local energy markets in Scotland.&nbsp; <strong>Hydro</strong> projects make up more than half of Scotland's small-scale renewables (<strong>1.2 GW</strong>), followed by <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>0.4 GW</strong>),&nbsp;<strong>solar PV</strong> (<strong>0.3 GW</strong>) and <strong>biomass/energy from waste</strong> (<strong>0.2 GW</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
