<p><strong>2019</strong> was a <strong>record year</strong> for <strong>renewable electricity generation</strong> in Scotland with <strong>30.5 TWh</strong> generated, <strong>13.6% up</strong> on <strong>2018</strong>. This is the equivalent of powering all households in Scotland for over three years, or charging almost 6.7 billion mobile phones for a year.</p>
<p><strong>Scotland</strong> made up over a quarter (<strong>25.3%</strong>) of the <strong>UK</strong>&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation in 2019.</p>
<p>Scotland is potentially on track for a <strong>stronger year</strong> of renewable electricity generation in <strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <strong>first half</strong> of <strong>2020</strong>, Scotland&nbsp;generated <strong>17.5 TWh</strong> of renewable&nbsp;electricity, <strong>up 16.6%</strong> on the same&nbsp;point in <strong>2019</strong>, and is the equivalent&nbsp;of almost three quarters of&nbsp;Scotland's annual electricity&nbsp;consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Increases</strong> in <strong>rainfall</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>wind speed</strong>&nbsp;in Q1 2020 contributed to this - compared to the first half of 2019, <strong>onshore&nbsp;wind</strong> generation is <strong>up 13.4%</strong>, <strong>offshore wind&nbsp;</strong>generation is <strong>up 25.0%</strong> and <strong>hydro&nbsp;</strong>generation <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>32.5%</strong></p>
<p>The majority of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable electricity generation continues to come from <strong>wind</strong> (<strong>22.3 TWh </strong>in <strong>2019</strong>). <strong>Offshore wind</strong> grew substantially in <strong>2019</strong>; <strong>3.2 TWh</strong> was generated last year via offshore wind, up from <strong>1.4 TWh</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>. This is due to the Beatrice wind farm off the Caithness coast becoming fully operational in May 2019.</p>
