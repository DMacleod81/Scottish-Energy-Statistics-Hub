<p>For energy supplies to remain secure, the system must be able to meet <strong>demand </strong>at <strong>peak times</strong>. Hence <strong>seasonality </strong>is key as demand is <strong>higher </strong>in the <strong>winter </strong>than the <strong>summer</strong>. The chart illustrates this, showing Scotland&rsquo;s energy use on a daily basis from 2013. It shows that <strong>seasonal variations </strong>in the demand for <strong>electricity </strong>are much <strong>smaller </strong>than they are for <strong>gas</strong>.</p>
<p>During the winter of 2019/20 <strong>the peak daily demand</strong> for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>gas</strong></span> was <strong>293 GWh </strong>(on 18<sup>th</sup> November 2019). This was more than <strong>five times greater </strong>than the minimum gas demand in summer 2019 (<strong>55 GWh </strong>on 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2019).&nbsp; The <strong>peak hourly demand</strong> for <strong>gas</strong> was <strong>14.6 GW</strong> at 6pm on 11th February 2020.</p>
<p>In 2019/20, <strong>peak <span style="text-decoration: underline;">electricity</span> daily demand </strong>(<strong>96 GWh</strong>, also on the 18<sup>th</sup> November 2019) was <strong>double </strong>that of <strong>minimum </strong>demand (<strong>50 GWh</strong> on the 18<sup>th</sup> August 2019).&nbsp; The <strong>peak half-hourly demand</strong> for <strong>electricity</strong> was <strong>5.0&nbsp;GW</strong> at 5pm on 12th December 2019.</p>
