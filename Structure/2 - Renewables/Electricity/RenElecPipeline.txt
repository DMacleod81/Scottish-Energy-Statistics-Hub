<p>As of <strong>September 2020, 286 </strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>13.9 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. <strong>2.0&nbsp;GW</strong> of these are <strong>under construction</strong>, most of which are <strong>offshore wind</strong> farms off the Moray Firth.&nbsp; <strong>7.6 GW </strong>are awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>4.4 GW in planning</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were all capacity in the pipeline to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed, and could generate an estimated <strong>32.9 TWh </strong>of renewable electricity. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors that mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
