<p>Since <strong>1998, </strong>Greenhouse gas <strong>Emissions</strong> associated with electricity generation has fallen 87.9%, from <strong>17.8</strong> <strong>million tonnes</strong> of <strong>CO2</strong> to <strong>2.2</strong> <strong>million tonnes</strong> of <strong>CO2</strong> in <strong>2018. </strong>This has been almost entirely driven by a reduction in emissions from power stations.</p>
<p>However, between <strong>2017</strong> and <strong>2018</strong> electricity emissions <strong>almost doubled</strong>. This follows long-term outages at Hunterson B leading to <strong>reduced nuclear generation</strong>, which was replaced with an <strong>increase </strong>in <strong>gas</strong> being used to <strong>generate electricity</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
