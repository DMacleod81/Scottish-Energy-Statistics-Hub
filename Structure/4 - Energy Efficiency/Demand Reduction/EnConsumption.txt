<p>It is possible to break down the reduction of Scotland&rsquo;s total energy consumption by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sector</strong></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy consumption in <strong>industry </strong>makes up approximately a third of all Scottish consumption (<strong>38.6 TWh</strong>). This is a <strong>29.2% reduction</strong> from the 2005-07 baseline, down <strong>4.8%</strong> up on <strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Energy consumption in the <strong>domestic sector </strong>is <strong>41.8</strong><strong>&nbsp;TWh</strong>.&nbsp; This is a <strong>decrease</strong> of <strong>19.0%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong>, which may reflect improvements in energy efficiency in the domestic building stock in this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consumption in the <strong>commercial </strong>sector <strong>fell </strong>by <strong>12.0% </strong>from the baseline to <strong>20.6 TWh </strong>in <strong>2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes in consumption of different <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fuels</strong></span> in Scotland has also changed over time:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petroleum</strong> products continue to make up the biggest proportion of Scotland's energy fuel mix,<strong> 59.9 TWh</strong> in <strong>2021</strong>, down <strong>19.8%</strong> from the <strong>2005-07</strong> baseline, and <strong>up 7.5%</strong> on <strong>2020</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gas</strong> comprises about a third of all consumption (<strong>47.0 TWh</strong>), down <strong>21.4%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong></li>
<li>Scotland consumes <strong>22.9 TWh</strong> of <strong>electricity</strong>, <strong>down 21.7%</strong> from the baseline</li>
<li>Consumption of <strong>coal</strong> decreased the most in comparison to <strong>2005/07</strong>, <strong>dropping 55.5% </strong>to <strong>0.8 TWh</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The only fuel type where consumption <strong>increased</strong> is <strong>bioenergy</strong> and <strong>energy from waste</strong>, which has almost quadrupled between 2005-07 and 2021 (<strong>6.6 TWh</strong>).&nbsp;</li>
