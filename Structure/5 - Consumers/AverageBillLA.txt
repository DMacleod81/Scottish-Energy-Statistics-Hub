<p>Using average consumption data by local authority and the average variable unit and fixed cost for North and South Scotland, it is possible to estimate what an average energy bill cost is for households in each local authority. This reveals large differences in energy bills across Scotland; <strong>Shetland Islands</strong> have on average the <strong>highest electricity</strong> bills (<strong>&pound;1,836</strong>), although this is likely to be because Shetland is reliant on electricity for heating more than other local authorities. <strong>Glasgow City</strong> has the <strong>lowest</strong> average electricity bill (<strong>&pound;651</strong>). <strong>East Renfrewshire</strong> has the <strong>highest</strong> average <strong>gas</strong> bill (<strong>&pound;684</strong>) and <strong>Glasgow City</strong> has the <strong>lowest</strong> average gas bill (<strong>&pound;475</strong>).</p>
<p>The average total bill figures by local authority are an indicative estimate and caution should be employed when interpreting these figures due to the varying number of households who have access to a gas supply.</p>
