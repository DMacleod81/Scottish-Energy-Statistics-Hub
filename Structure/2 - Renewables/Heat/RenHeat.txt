<p>Scotland generated <strong>5,632 GWh </strong>of renewable heat in <strong>2022</strong>, a record year for renewable heat. This is the equivalent of supplying over <strong>440,000 Scottish homes&nbsp;</strong>with gas for the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">When describing <strong>non-industrial, non-electrical heat,</strong> we report on both an upper and lower estimate. This is because it is not always possible to determine whether or not heat is used for industrial purposes.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal x_ContentPasted0">In <strong>2021,</strong> the percentage of <strong>non-electrical, non-industrial heat demand</strong> met by renewable sources is estimated at between <strong>3.2%</strong> and <strong>7.1%</strong>.&nbsp;Between <strong>1.4</strong> and <strong>3.2</strong> <strong>TWh</strong> of renewable heat output was produced in <strong>2021</strong>, when demand for non-electrical, non-industrial heat was estimated at <strong>45.4 TWh</strong>.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal x_ContentPasted0"><strong>2021</strong> showed significant growth in overall <strong>renewable heat output</strong> (including industrial heat), with a gain of <strong>650 GWh</strong>.</p>
