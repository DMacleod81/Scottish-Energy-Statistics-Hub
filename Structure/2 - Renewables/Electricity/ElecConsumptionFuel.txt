<p>It is possible to look at the&nbsp;<strong>fuel mix</strong>&nbsp;which makes up&nbsp;<strong>regional consumption</strong>&nbsp;via the National Grid&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk/">Carbon Intensity website</a>.</p>
<p>It shows that in the twelve months ending <strong>June 2020,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>86.5%</strong>&nbsp;of the electricity that&nbsp;<strong>Scotland</strong>&nbsp;<strong>consumed</strong>&nbsp;came from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;sources, with more than half (<strong>56.0%</strong>) from&nbsp;<strong>renewable</strong>&nbsp;sources. More than two-fifths (<strong>44.4%</strong>) of the electricity consumed in Scotland came from&nbsp;<strong>wind</strong>&nbsp;generation. As with generation,&nbsp;<strong>consumption</strong>&nbsp;from electricity from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>53.7%</strong>) and&nbsp;<strong>renewable</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>34.5%</strong>) sources are substantially&nbsp;<strong>lower</strong>&nbsp;across&nbsp;<strong>England and Wales</strong>.</p>
