<p>Scotland had <strong>11.8 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in December 2019</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, and has increased from <strong>11.0 GW </strong>twelve months prior.&nbsp; Capacity has, however, levelled off since June 2019.&nbsp; Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>8.3 GW</strong>), with <strong>offshore wind</strong> capacity growing rapidly (<strong>1.0 GW</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>As of December 2019, 278 </strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>13.0 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. <strong>1.2 GW</strong><span> of these are </span><strong>under construction</strong><span>, most of which are </span><strong>offshore wind</strong><span> farms off the Moray Firth.</span>&nbsp; <strong>7.7 GW </strong>are awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>4.1 GW in planning</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were all capacity in the pipeline to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed, and could generate an estimated <strong>31.2 TWh </strong>of renewable electricity. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors that mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
