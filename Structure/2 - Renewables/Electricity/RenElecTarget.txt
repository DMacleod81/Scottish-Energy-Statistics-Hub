<p>The Scottish Government had a target to generate the equivalent of <strong>100%</strong>&nbsp;of Scotland&rsquo;s own electricity demand from renewable sources by&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean that Scotland will be fully dependent on renewables generation, but rather that renewables will form the key part of a wider, balanced electricity mix.</p>
<p>The renewable electricity target is no longer an official target as the target year of 2020 has been reported on. Final figures for <strong>2020</strong> indicated that the equivalent of <strong>98.1%</strong> of gross electricity consumption was from renewable sources. This falls short of the 100% by 2020<strong> renewable electricity target.</strong></p>
<p>Although the target year has passed, we are continuing to monitor progress of the metric. Final figures for <strong>2021 </strong>indicate that the equivalent of <strong>85.0% </strong>of gross electricity consumption was from renewable sources, decreasing from <strong>98.1% </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>. This is a <strong>13.1</strong> percentage point decrease compared to 2020, which is due to milder weather in 2021 negatively impacting renewable electricity generation.</p>
