<p>The Greenhouse Gas Inventory breaks down emissions specifically relating to the <strong>supply of energy</strong>.&nbsp; This is further split into emissions associated with the <strong>generation of electricity</strong> and <strong>industrial processes</strong> associated with energy supply, for example, oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining and manufacturing of solid fuels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a&nbsp;<strong>baseline</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>21.7 million tonnes of CO2</strong>, greenhouse gas<strong>&nbsp;emissions</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>energy supply</strong>&nbsp;sector have&nbsp;<strong>fallen 77.4%</strong> to <strong>4.9&nbsp;million tonnes of CO2</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2021</strong>. This in large part due to changes in&nbsp;<strong>electricity production</strong>, where a&nbsp;<strong>reduction</strong>&nbsp;in the use of&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuels</strong> for electricity generation has led to an <strong>91.2% decrease</strong> in emissions to&nbsp;<strong>2021</strong>.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions associated with industrial processes associated with energy supply have also fallen,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>from <strong>6.9</strong>&nbsp;<strong>million tonnes of CO2</strong> in <strong>1999</strong> to a <strong>low</strong> of <strong>3.6&nbsp;million tonnes of CO2 </strong>in<strong> 2021.</strong></p>
