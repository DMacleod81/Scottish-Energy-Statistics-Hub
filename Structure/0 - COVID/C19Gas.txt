<p><strong>Gas demand has also reduced</strong></p>
<p>The same average daily demand analysis for gas is in the chart above.&nbsp; This is trickier to interpret as gas demand depends largely on climatic conditions, hence variations in previous years.&nbsp; The data available has not been weather corrected.&nbsp; However, average weekday daily gas demand has dropped by <strong>34%</strong> since lockdown.&nbsp; It is likely that at least some of this reduction is because of reduced activity since lockdown. &nbsp;Indeed, National Grid expects that any growth in domestic demand due to people being housebound during lockdown will be far outweighed by the expected reduction in demand from businesses and industry.</p>
