<p><strong>Restricted</strong>&nbsp;<strong>meters</strong>&nbsp;include any metering arrangement whereby a domestic customer&rsquo;s consumption at certain times and, in some cases, for certain purposes is separately recorded. These meters allow for customers to be charged lower rates for electricity used at times when overall demand is lower.</p>
<p>The main type of restricted meters used in Scotland are&nbsp;<strong>economy 7 meters</strong>. There were approximately <strong>410,000</strong>&nbsp;of these meters in Scotland in <strong>2018</strong>, which makes up&nbsp;<strong>13.3%</strong>&nbsp;of all meters. This has steadily dropped from just over <strong>505,000</strong> meters (<strong>16.8%</strong> of all meters) in <strong>2010</strong>.&nbsp; Off-gas grid local authorities have the highest proportion of economy 7 meters: <strong>43.1% </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>Shetland</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>35.1%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Orkney</strong>.</p>
