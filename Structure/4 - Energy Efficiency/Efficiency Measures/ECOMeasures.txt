<p>The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a Government energy efficiency scheme that began operating in 2013. &nbsp;ECO delivers energy efficiency measures in homes across Great Britain in order to reduce energy costs for low income households. ECO is funded through a charge on the energy bills of all customers of regulated energy companies (currently those with over 250,000 customers).</p>
<p>Since 2013, approximately <strong>12.6%</strong> of all households receiving <strong>ECO</strong> <strong>measures</strong> were delivered in <strong>Scotland</strong>.&nbsp; This is around <strong>13.5%</strong> of all <strong>households</strong> in <strong>Scotland</strong>, higher than Scotland&rsquo;s overall share of GB households (9.2%).</p>
<p>Up to the end of <strong>September 2019</strong>, there were almost <strong>327,000</strong> <strong>measures</strong> installed in households in Scotland. Almost <strong>7,800</strong> measures were installed from <strong>July</strong> to <strong>September</strong> <strong>2019</strong>, down from 11,200 in the same quarter in 2018. All of the measures were delivered via the <strong>Affordable Warmth obligation</strong>. <strong>18.7%</strong> of which met the <strong>rural</strong> sub-obligation.</p>
<p>In total, almost <strong>273,000 households</strong> in Scotland were in receipt of ECO measures, <strong>13.5%</strong> of all households. In <strong>quarter 3 2019</strong>, approximately <strong>4,750</strong> households were in receipt of ECO measures, half the amount in quarter 3 2018.</p>
