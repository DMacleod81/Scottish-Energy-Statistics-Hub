<p>Scottish Government's&nbsp;overall approach to energy is driven by the need&nbsp;to decarbonise the whole energy system, in line&nbsp;with emissions levels set out in the Climate&nbsp;Change (Scotland) Act.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2019/15/contents/enacted">Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Act 2019</a>&nbsp;set <strong>targets</strong> to reduce Scotland's <strong>emissions</strong> of all greenhouse gases to <strong>net-zero</strong> by <strong>2045</strong> at the latest, five years ahead of the UK.&nbsp; The Act also sets <strong>interim targets</strong> for <strong>reductions</strong> of at least <strong>56%</strong> by <strong>2020</strong>, <strong>75%</strong> by <strong>2030</strong>, <strong>90%</strong> by <strong>2040</strong> from a <strong>baseline</strong> of emissions in <strong>1990</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, Scottish source <strong>emissions</strong> of the basket of seven greenhouse gases were estimated to be <strong>41.6 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent</strong> (MtCO2e). This is <strong>2.4% higher</strong>&nbsp;than <strong>2020</strong>. The main contributors to this increase between 2020 and 2021 were <strong>increases </strong>in emissions in the <strong>Domestic Transport, Agriculture, Residential and Forestry</strong>&nbsp;sectors.</p>
<p>Between <strong>1990</strong> and <strong>2021</strong>, there was a <strong>49.1%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>reduction</strong> in estimated emissions. The most significant contributors to this&nbsp;overall reduction were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall in&nbsp;<strong>waste management</strong>&nbsp;emissions (such as Landfill) (<strong>down 76.2%</strong>)</li>
<li>Fall in <strong>energy supply</strong> emissions (<strong>down 77.6%</strong>)</li>
<li>Fall in <strong>business</strong> emissions (<strong>down 35.3%</strong>)</li>
<li>Following a <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-greenhouse-gas-statistics-1990-2019/pages/5/">change in methodology</a>, <strong>l</strong><strong>and use, land use change, and f</strong><strong>orestry</strong> is no longer a carbon sink, however emisions from this sector have fallen significantly (<strong>down 94.1%)</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest factor <strong>slowing</strong> the overall <strong>reduction</strong> is <strong>transport</strong>. This sector was the largest contributor in 2020 at <strong>10.9 MtCO2e</strong>, however has shown only a <strong>19.3% decrease</strong> since <strong>1990</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent of <strong>73.9%</strong> of Scotland&rsquo;s total greenhouse gas <strong>emissions</strong> are associated with <strong>energy</strong> (i.e. the electricity, heat, transport and industry sectors). As a proportion, this has remained similar to <strong>1990</strong> with a slight increase from <strong>73.8%</strong> since then, showing the importance of further decarbonisation of the energy sector.</p>
